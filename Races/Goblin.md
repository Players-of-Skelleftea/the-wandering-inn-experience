Goblins are a humanoid race, with green skin and crimson eyes as their most recognizable features. Normal adults are on average around four feet tall, unless they have developed into Hobgoblins who are often more the size of an adult human.

Goblins are often considered monsters by other humanoid races. In reality only some of them are monsters, the others are just people.
