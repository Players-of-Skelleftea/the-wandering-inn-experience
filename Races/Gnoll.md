One of the three dominant races on the continent of Izril. They are a tribal, semi-nomadic people of hunter-gatherers that resemble large, bipedal hyenas. The currently share southern Izril with the Drakes, with whom they are loosely affiliated.

It would be easy to mistake Gnolls as uncultured, savage half-beasts, mere relics of a more primal age who have only survived to this day on the coattails of the Drakes. The majority of the world does so. But the truth is rather more complex. Theirs is a reclusive, pragmatic, self-sufficient, fully civilized, and highly organized society that keeps its substantial ambition as close as they keep to each other.
