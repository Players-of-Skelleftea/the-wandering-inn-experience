Antinium, also known as The Black Tide and The Invaders from Rhir, are a race of strange ant-like people that had invaded [[Izril]] years ago and fought in two bloody wars known as the First and Second Antinium Wars. 

They live in underground Hives and mainly come in two varieties, [[Worker Antinium]] and [[Soldier Antinium]]. More specialized versions exist, but they vary from Hive to Hive.
