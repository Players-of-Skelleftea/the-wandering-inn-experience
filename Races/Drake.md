Drakes are humanoid Dragon-like beings, and one of the races of [[Innworld]]. Though they are the descendants of the great Dragons of old, they only bear a passing resemblance to them, and distinctly are mortal beings.

The stereotypical Drakes are orderly people, readily obeying their own authorities, and sticking to their laws strictly. These laws are seemingly put into place to make Drake society a possibility, since Drakes tend to be very possessive and unwilling to share.
