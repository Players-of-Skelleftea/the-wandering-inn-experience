The original Wandering Inn was located much further from [[Liscor]] than the second, newer inn, built in its first iteration by the [[Antinium]] as a newer replica of that first building, after [[Toren]]'s mishap with explosive bark.

The Wandering Inn is roughly twenty minutes away from [[Liscor]] on a hill. This second inn had an outhouse, and was much closer to [[Liscor]], providing a much more attractive location to customers.

In addition, Erin now had the ability to quickly restock her supplies. The new inn also had a basement which was large enough to house all the food supplies as well as a party of adventurers.

The newer inn eventually also gains a [[Garden of Sanctuary]].
