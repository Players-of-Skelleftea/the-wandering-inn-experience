The city sits on the Floodplains that divide Southern [[Izril]] from the human-colonized northern half of the continent. It has a lot of natural defences; the only way to reach it is from the north and the south. The mountains make it impassable, and the southern border is guarded by the highly dangerous Blood Fields. Furthermore, it is always flooded for the first two months of Spring every year, due to its natural geography and nonstop rainfall. During this flooded period, powerful monsters populate the flooded waters.

Most of the early customers of [[The Wandering Inn]] were residents of Liscor.
