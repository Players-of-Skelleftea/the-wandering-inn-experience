The Players of Celum is a troupe of Actors that was formed thanks to [[Erin]]. She was able to transcribe a bunch of classical plays for them because of a memory skill.

After the troupe left Celum and divided in two, with one staying in [[Liscor]] and the other in [[Invrisil]], they are now respectively called the Players of Liscor and the Players of Invrisil.
