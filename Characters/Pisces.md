Pisces Jealnet is a [Necromancer], and a regular customer of The Wandering Inn.

To most people, Pisces can come off as an arrogant and obnoxious jerk with an odd habit of sniffing when displaying scorn or showing off. He has a habit of using seven words when one word would suffice. Pisces often believes himself to be the smartest person in the room and enjoys lording over his intellectual superiority over others. While this attitude sometimes gets him into trouble, he is not ignorant of the way it makes others view him, and occasionally even acts more arrogant than he really is in order to manipulate those around him.
