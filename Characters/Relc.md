Race: [[Drakes]]

Relc Grasstongue, also known as the Gecko of Liscor, is a Drake and a Senior Guardsman of [[Liscor]].

Relc is often immature. He prefers personal gratification such as eating or finding nice rocks to laze about upon while he should be performing his duties, much to the exasperation of Watch Captain Zevara. However, he is serious about performing his duties when the situation calls for it and is dependable in a fight. Relc is also fiercely loyal to his friends and willing to own up to his mistakes.

Relc can be inordinately proud of his physical prowess, and loves to fight. He is also extremely fond of food, puzzles and theatre.
