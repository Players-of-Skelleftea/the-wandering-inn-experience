Bird is an Individual [[Worker Antinium]] who was formerly a part of [[Liscor]]'s [[Antinium Hive]]. He currently resides in [[The Wandering Inn]] as security.

Bird is considered "weird" even by the other [[Antinium]]. His defining trait is his obsession with all types of birds, which manifests in hunting and eating them. He loves to hunt and often tries to challenge himself. As such, his archery ability is almost unparalleled, being able to accurately hit his target from hundreds of feet away.[3] Bird has a child-like nature, often singing nonsense songs, and overall is shown to be uncomplicated and innocent in his desires and wants, perfectly content with living at the inn and hunting birds.
